This code is a numerical solver for the 1D shallow water equation using the Adams-Bashforth method. The solver is specifically tailored to simulate the behavior of dipolar, tripolar, and hexagonal vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. The shallow water equations provide a simplified representation of atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics, making it a suitable model for studying large-scale vortices and wave propagation.

Requirements
Python 3.x
